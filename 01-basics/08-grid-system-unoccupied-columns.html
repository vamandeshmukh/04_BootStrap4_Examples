        <p class="font-weight-bold">Usually a row is split into columns where the columns of the row take up full width
            of row. However this is not necessary. Here we split as 3 + 6 (3 columns to right remain).</p>

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
                PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
